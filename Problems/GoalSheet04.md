# Goal Sheet 04

**methods, substrings, input**

**Problem GS04-01 - padString**

Write a method called padString that accepts two parameters: a String and an integer representing a length.  The method should pad the parameter String with spaces until its length is the given length. (BJP Ch 3 Ex 11)

**Problem GS04-02 - printReverse**

Write a method called printReverse that accepts a String as its parameter and prints the characters in opposite order.  An empty String should produce no output. (BJP Ch 3 Ex 13)

**Problem GS04-03 - processName**

Write a method called processName that accepts a Scanner for the console as a parameter and promts the user to enter a full name (as a single String).  Output the name in reverse order. (BJP Ch 3 Ex 15)

**Problem GS04-04 - substrings**

Write a method that takes a string and an integer (maximum length) and outputs the necessary substrings of the given length (the last one may be shorter) of the original String on separate lines.

**Problem GS04-05 - stairString**

Write a method called stairString that takes two parameters as input, a String and an integer representing the number of lines the String will be on.  The method will divide the String into the number of substrings indicated and then output the substrings so that each substring is placed one line below the next in the same horizontal location it would have been had they been on the same line.  For example stairString(“The End”, 2); would output
The
    End
An empty string and/or a line number less than 1, will create no output.  You must use the substring method to receive any credit.
