# Goal Sheet 02

**Output and Static Methods**

**Problem GS02-01 - Output Squares**

Do BJP Ch 2 Exercise 2.  Write a program to output the squares of the numbers 1 to a given number.  (Challenge yourself to do it without multiplying or using powers.)

**Problem GS02-02 - Fibonacci series**

Do BJP Ch 2 exercise 3.  Write a program to output a given number of the Fibonacci series.  (Use nested loops and not recursion.)  You can have a method to find a given number in the series and a method that calls that method.

**Problem GS02-03 - ASCII Stair**

Do BJP Ch 2 Project 4.  Write a program that produces the ASCII stair output (see book figure).  Use a class constant to make it possible to change the number of stairs in the figure.

**Problem GS02-04 - Quadratic**

Do BJP Ch 3 Exercise 8.  Write a method called *quadratic* (and testing code for it) that takes three parameters (the coefficients of a polynomial equation) and outputs the roots.

**Problem GS02-05 - Triangle**

Do BJP Ch 3 Project 4.  Write a program that prompts for the three sides of a triangle and reports the three angles.

**Problem GS02-06 - AP Practice**

Sign up on the AP site if you have not done so yet.  Start/continue multiple choice packet of practice problems.
