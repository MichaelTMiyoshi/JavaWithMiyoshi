# Problems
These problem statements in this folder are the ones I use in my class.  I group them into what I call goal sheets (which are how they are named in the files here).  Each goal sheet is slated to take two weeks.

Many/most of the problems are taken from the textbook we use in class.  I use the book *Building Java Programs* by Reges and Stepp.  I use the description BJP to note that the problem is from our textbook.  The chapter and exercise or project are given to fully describe the problem.  The problems in the goal sheets are just short descriptions, or the whole problem statement if the problem is short.  I believe all our textbooks in my classroom are early editions of the book.  Which is why I suggest that those who want to use PracticeIt as a companion to the course use the 3rd edition problems.

## Topics and Goal Sheets
Below are the goal sheets with their associated descriptions (including the catch up goal sheets).

### Notes
* The Advanced Goal Sheet is simply a tool I use for my advanced students to tell me what progress they are making toward finishing their games or apps.  My intro students (who use my book and perhaps this repo) create their own games based on the Game Engine Tutorial.  Those six weeks are what many of them have longed for from day one.  But by the time they get there, they realize that they had so much to learn along the way.
