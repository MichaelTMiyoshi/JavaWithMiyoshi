# Goal Sheet 05

**Arrays**

Note: BJP = Building Java Programs (by Reges and Stepp)

**Problem GS05-01 - Output Squares**

Use a two-dimensional array to write a game of Tic-Tac-Toe that represents the board.  (BJP Ch 7 Proj 5)

**Problem GS05-02 - Hangman**

Write a game of Hangman using arrays.  Allow the user to guess letters and represent which letters have been guessed in an array.  (BJP Ch 7 Proj 2)

**Problem GS05-03 - Mastermind (worth triple points)**

Write a program that plays a variation of the game Mastermind with a user.  The program should generate a four digit number.  User allowed to guess until she gets the number correct.  Clues are given to the user indicating how many digits are correct and in the correct place.  (BJP Ch 7 Proj 3)

You should output two things after the user guesses.  The number of digits that are correct AND in the correct location.  The number of digits that are correct BUT not in the correct location.  These are mutually exclusive.  A digit cannot be both in the correct location and not in the correct location.

Below is a test case to test your code.  Make sure that your "Secret" is the give number and then use the guesses to check your outputs to see that they match up with the test.

Secret number: 6684

Guess | Correct Digit, Correct Location | Correct Digit, Wrong Location
----- | ------------------------------- | -----------------------------
0000 | 0 | 0
6666 | 2 | 0
0123 | 0 | 0
4567 | 0 | 2
4589 | 1 | 1
6700 | 1 | 0
0798 | 0 | 1
6484 | 3 | 0
6480 | 2 | 1
6884 | 3 | 0
6684 | 4 | 0
