# Goal Sheet 15, Goal Sheet 16, Goal Sheet 17, and Goal Sheet 18

The Advanced Goal Sheet is simply a tool I use for my AP Computer Science students to tell me what progress they are making toward finishing their final projects.  They do these projects after they finish getting ready for the AP CS test.  However, some of them get started much earlier than that.  Some even start coding their final projects long before they have coded much in Java.
