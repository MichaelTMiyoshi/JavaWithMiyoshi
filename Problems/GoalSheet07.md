# Goal Sheet 07

**Lists and Classes**

Note: BJP = Building Java Programs (by Reges and Stepp)

**Problem GS07-01 - scaleByK (half)**

Write a method called scaleByK that takes an ArrayList of integers as a parameter and replaces every integer of value K with K copies of itself.  For example, if the list stores the values (4,1,2,0,3) before the call, it should store the values (4,4,4,4,1,2,2,3,3,3) after the call.  Zeroes and negative numbers should be removed by this method. (BJP Ch 10 Ex 5)

**Problem GS07-02 - minToFront (half)**

Write a method called minToFront that takes an ArrayList of integers as a parameter and moves the minimum value in the list to the front, otherwise preserving the order of the elements. (BJP Ch 10 Ex 6)

**Problem GS07-03 - Modify Point Class**

Modify the Point class from chapter 8 so that it defines a natural ordering by implementing the Comparable interface.  Compare the points by y-major order; that is, points with smaller y-coordinate values should come before those with higher y-coordinate values.  Break ties by comparing x-coordinate values. (BJP Ch 10 Ex 17)

**Problem GS07-04 - CalendarDate**

Modify the CalendarDate class from this chapter to include a year field, and modify its compareTo method to take years into account when making comparisons. (BJP Ch 10 Ex 19)

**Problem GS07-05 - Reverse words and lines**

Write a program to reverse the lines of a file and also to reverse the order of the words in each line of the file.  Use ArrayLists to help you. (BJP Ch 10 Proj 2)

**Problem GS07-06 - Elevens (APCS Lab)**

Start looking at the first APCS lab called Elevens.  Complete the starter code activities.

**Problem GS07-07 - AP Practice**

Sign up on the AP site if you have not done so yet.  Start/continue multiple choice packet of practice problems.
