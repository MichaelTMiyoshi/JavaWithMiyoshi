**Recursion**

Note: BJP = Building Java Programs (by Reges and Stepp)

**Problem GS11-01 - starString**

Write a recursive method called starString that accepts an integer as a parameter and prints to the console a string of stars (asterisks) that is 2n (i.e.2 to the nth power) long.  (BJP Ch 12 Ex 1)

**Problem GS11-02 - writeNums**

Write a recursive method called writeNums that takes an integer n as a parameter and prints to the console the first n integers starting with 1 in sequential order, separated by commas.  (BJP Ch 12 Ex 2)

**Problem GS11-03 - writeSequence**

Write a recursive method called writeSequence that accepts an integer n as a parameter and prints to the console a symmetric sequence of n numbers composed of descending integers that ends in 1, followed by a sequence of ascending integers that begins with 1.  When n is odd, the sequence has a single 1 in the middle, but when n is even, it has two 1s in the middle.  Throw an IllegalArgumentException if it is passed a value less than 1.  (BJP Ch 12 Ex 3)

**Problem GS11-04 - sumTo**

Write a recursive method called sumTo that accepts an integer parameter n and returns a real number representing the sum of the first n reciprocals.  In other words, sumTo(n) returns (1 + ½ + 1/3 + ¼ + … + 1/n).  For example, sumTo(2) should return 1.5.  The method should return 0.0 if it is passed the value 0 and thro an IllegalArgumentException if it passed a value less than 0.  (BJP Ch 12 Ex 9)

**Problem GS11-05 - Fibonacci (more efficient recursive)**

The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the first two numbers are 1 and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers.  The sequence is 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on.  Write a new version of the method given in the book that is still recursive and has the same header but is more efficient.  Do this by creating a helper method that accepts additional parameters, such as previous Fibonacci numbers, that you can carry through and modify during each recursive call.  (BJP Ch 12 Problem 16) Fibonacci another way (more efficiently)

**Problem GS11-06 - AP Free Response Practice**

Start/continue free response practice problems.
