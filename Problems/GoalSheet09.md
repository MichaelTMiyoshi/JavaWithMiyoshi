# Goal Sheet 09

**Lists, Sets, Maps**

Note: BJP = Building Java Programs (by Reges and Stepp)

**Problem GS09-01 - Partition**

Write a method called partition that accepts a list of integers and an integer value E as its parameters, and rearranges (partitions) the list so that all elements with values less than E occur before all elements with values greater than E.  The exact order of the elements is unimportant, so long as all elements less than E appear before all elements greater than E.  (BJP Ch 11 Ex 4)  (Make sure that if the partition value is in the list, the partition value appears between the list sections as many times as it is in the list.)

**Problem GS09-02 - countUnique**

Write a method called countUnique that accepts a list of integers as a parameter and returns the number of unique integer values in the list.  Use a set as auxiliary storage to help you solve this problem.  (BJP Ch 11 Ex 6)

**Problem GS09-03 - maxLength**

Write a method maxLength that accepts a set of strings as a parameter and that returns the length of the longest string in the list.  If your method is passed an empty set, it should return 0.  (BJP Ch 11 Ex 8)

**Problem GS09-04 - rarest**

Write a method called rarest that accepts a map whose keys are strings and whose values are integers as a parameter and returns the integer value that occurs the fewest times in the map.  If there is a tie, return the smaller integer value.  If the map is empty, throw an exception.  (BJP Ch 11 Ex 19)

**Problem GS09-05 - APCS Labs**

Do some meaningful modifications to the APCS labs.

**Problem GS09-06 - AP Practice**

Sign up on the AP site if you have not done so yet.  Start/continue multiple choice packet of practice problems.
