**Recursion and Sorting**

Note: BJP = Building Java Programs (by Reges and Stepp)

**Problem GS02-01 - Fibonacci (recursive)**

Write a recursive method that takes an integer argument n and gives the nth number in the Fibonacci series.  Your method that tests the recursive method (may use a loop) should display the series up through the nth number.

**Problem GS02-02 - writeSquares**

Write a recursive method called writeSquares that accepts an integer parameter n and prints the first n squares separated by commas, with the odd squares in descending order followed by the even squares in ascending order.  For example, writeSquares(8); prints the following output:

49, 25, 9, 1, 4, 16, 36, 64  (BJP Ch 12 Ex 6)

**Problem GS02-03 - Selection Sort (modified)**

Write a modified version of the selection sort algorithm that selects the largest element each time and moves it to the end of the array, rather than selecting the smallest element and moving it to the beginning.  Will this algorithm be faster than the standard selection sort?  What will its complexity class (big-O) be?  (BJP Ch 13 Ex 8)

**Problem GS02-04 - Merge Sort (double)**

Write a program that reads a series of input lines and sorts them into alphabetical order, ignoring the case of words.  The program should use the merge sort algorithm so that it efficiently sorts even a large file.  (BJP Ch 13 Proj 1)

**Problem GS02-05 - APCS Labs (no points)**

Finish APCS Labs

**Problem GS02-06 - AP Free Response Practice**

Start/continue free response practice problems.
