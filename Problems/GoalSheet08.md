**Problem GS08-01 - removeInRange**

Write a method called removeInRange that accepts four parameters: a LinkedList, an element value, a starting index, and an editing index.  The method’s behavior is to remove all occurrences of the given element that appear in the list between the starting index (inclusive) and the ending index (exclusive).  Other values and occurrences of the given value that appear outside the given index range are not affected. (BJP Ch 11 Ex 3)

**Problem GS08-02 - sortAndRemoveDuplicates (half)**

Write a method called sortAndRemoveDuplicates that accepts a list of integers as its parameter and rearranges the list’s elements into sorted ascending order, as well as removing all duplicate values from the list.  For example, the list {7, 4, -9, 4, 15, 8, 27, 7, 11, -5, 32, -9, -9} would become {-9, -5, 4, 7, 8, 11, 15, 27, 32} after a call to your method.  Use a Set as part of your solution.  (BJP Ch 11 Ex 5)

**Problem GS08-03 - removeEvenLength (half)**

Write a method removeEvenLength that accepts a set of strings as a parameter and that removes all of the strings of even length from the set. (BJP Ch 11 Ex 10)

**Problem GS08-04 - isUnique**

Write a method isUnique that accepts a map whose keys and values are strings as a parameter and returns true if no two keys map to the same value (and false if any two or more keys do map to the same value).  (BJP Ch 11 Ex 13)
