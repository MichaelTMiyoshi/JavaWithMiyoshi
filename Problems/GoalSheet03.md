# Goal Sheet 03

**Methods, Looping, Branching**

**Problem GS03-01 - repl**

Write a method called repl that accepts a String and a number of repetitions as parameters and returns the string concatenated that many times. For example, the call repl(“hello”, 3) should return “hellohellohello”. If the number of repetitions is zero or less, the method should return an empty string. (BJP Ch 4 Ex 2)

**Problem GS03-02 - printRange**

Write a method called printRange that accepts two integers as arguments and prints the sequence of numbers between the two arguments, enclosed in square brackets.  Print an increasing sequence if the first argument is smaller than the second; otherwise, print a decreasing sequence.  If the two numbers are the same, that number should be printed between square brackets.  (BJP Ch 4 Ex 5)

**Problem GS03-03 - Roman Numerals**

Write a program that prompts for a number and displays it in Roman numerals.  (BJP Ch 4 Proj 1)

**Problem GS03-04 - randomLines**

Write a method called randomLines that prints between 5 and 10 random Strings of letters (between “a” and “z”), one per line.  Each string should have a random length of up to 80 characters.  (BJP Ch 5 Ex 5)

**Problem GS03-05 - word, line, char counter**

Write a program that counts the number of words, lines, and total characters (not including whitespace) in a paper, assuming that consecutive words are separated either by spaces or end-of-line characters.  (BJP Ch. 6 Proj 1)
