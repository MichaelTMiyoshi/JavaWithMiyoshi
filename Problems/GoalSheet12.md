**Comparators, Searching, and Stuff**

Note: BJP = Building Java Programs (by Reges and Stepp)

**Problem GS12-01 - Binary Search**

Write code to read a dictionary from a file, then prompt the user for two words and tell the user how many words in the dictionary fall between those two words.  Use (implement) the binary search algorithm in your solution.  (BJP Ch 13 exercise 4)

**Problem GS12-02 - Comparator**

Write a Comparator that compares Point objects by their distance from the origin (0,0).  Points that are closer to the origin are considered to come before those which are further from the origin.  (BJP Ch 13 exercise 5)

**Problem GS12-03 - Selection Sort (modified)**

Write a modified “dual” version of the selection sort algorithm that selects both the largest and smallest elements on each pass and moves each of them to the appropriate end of the array.  Will this algorithm be faster than the standard selection sort?  What predictions would you make about its performance relative to the merge sort algorithm?  What would its complexity class be O()?  (BJP Ch 13 exercise 9)

**Problem GS12-04 - Data Processing (double)**

Write a program that processes a data file of students’ grade data.  The data arrive in random order; each line stores information about a student’s last name, first name, student ID number, grade as a percentage, and letter grade.  (See example table.)  You should be able to sort the data by any of the columns.  Use Comparators to achieve the sort orderings.  Make the data sortable by last name, student ID, and grade percentage in ascending and descending order.  (See example table.)  (BJP Ch 13 Project 3)

**Problem GS12-05 - APCS Free Response**

Start/continue free response practice problems.
