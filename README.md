# JavaWithMiyoshi
Companion repo for our AP CS class

This is the companion repo for my AP Computer Science class.  You will find the problems that you will be doing.

I will give you short descriptions of the problems in this repo.  However, I use *Building Java Programs* by Reges and Stepp in my classroom.  The full descriptions are there and I do not want to violate copyright by putting the full programs in the goal sheets.  If you do not have the book on hand, you can create an account on PracticeIt and see the full problems there.  You can also test your code at PracticeIt.  The 3rd edition ought to match the problems we use in my classroom.
